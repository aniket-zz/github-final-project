### About the GitHub documentation philosophy

As the home to the world's largest community of developers, we want to make sure that our documentation is accurate, valuable, inclusive, and easy to use. Our documentation philosophy leads us toward these goals.

 * We advocate for our users. This can occur at any point in the documentation process, from planning to writing to publishing. We respond to feedback and proactively work to create the best user experience possible on the GitHub Docs site.
* We write for an international audience, so that our content can be translated and is inclusive of all people.
* We create content that can be accessed by a broad group of users. Our content toolkit includes resources and guidance to reduce barriers for people with disabilities and we prioritize keeping up to date with the latest accessibility standards.
* We create task-based content. We consider what people are trying to accomplish when they use GitHub, and then we create content that helps them achieve their goals and discover new possibilities.
* We collaborate with teams across GitHub and the open source community to create high-quality content.
* We continually learn and improve to curate the best experience for people using GitHub.

### The GitHub Docs approach to style

* Our style guide aims for simplicity. Guidelines should be easy to apply to a range of scenarios.
* Decisions aren’t about what’s right or wrong according to the rules of grammar or the style guide, but about what’s best for our users. We're flexible and open to change while maintaining consistency.
* To scale the style guide as our team and documentation sets grow, and to create high-quality, meaningful content that serves users, we focus our attention on high-impact, high-value scenarios rather than attempting to comprehensively cover every style question.
* Consistency and grammatical correctness are important, but not as important as clarity and meaning.
* When making a style or structure decision, we consider the flow of information within the unit of content and the context of the information.
* When a question specific to help documentation isn’t covered by the style guide, we think it through using these principles, then make a decision. If a reviewer asks about it, we're prepared to discuss the decision.

### Audit log events

We document each of the events that may appear in the audit logs for each type of account: user, organization, and enterprise.

* "Security log events"
* "Audit log events for your organization"
* "Audit log events for your enterprise" in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation

When writing the description for an audit log event, describe the event that took place in a way that applies to all versions, using past tense and passive voice. Do not begin the sentence with phrases that are already implied by the context of the article, such as "Triggered by."

* Use: The visibility of a repository was changed.
* Use: Secret scanning was enabled for all new repositories.
* Avoid: An organization owner disabled a two-factor authentication requirement for the organization.
* Avoid: Triggered when a user updates which repositories a codespace can access.
